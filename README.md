# A Day In The Life of an Indian

As per the recent report "Time Use in India - 2019" by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, here's a glimpse into a day in the life of an Indian:

On an average weekday, an Indian spends around 9.5 hours on work and employment-related activities, which includes both paid and unpaid work. Household activities like cooking, cleaning, and caring for family members consume an additional 3.3 hours.

Surprisingly, leisure and self-care activities like sleeping, watching TV, and personal grooming only make up for 1.6 hours on an average weekday.

The report also highlights that the time spent on work and employment-related activities is higher for men compared to women, while women tend to spend more time on household activities.

 I created this mock dataset of 1000 individuals based on the 'Time Use in India - 2019' report, using my own analysis





As we strive for  work-life balance, it's important to understand how we spend our time and make conscious efforts to prioritize our well-being. #TimeUseInIndia  #WorkLifeBalance #GenderEquality
